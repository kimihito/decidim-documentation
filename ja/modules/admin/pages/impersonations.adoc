= Participants Impersonations

For participants that don't have the knowledge or don't have an email for registering an account, there's the Impersonation feature.

This allows an 'Administrator' or 'Participant manager' to search through a Verification system for an already existing participant and also to create a participant without email. 

NOTE: At the code and the User Interface we say both *Impersonation* and *Managed Participants*. Is the same thing.

## Panel

This is the panel where you can find all the participants: 
* by filtering by managed or not managed participants 
* by searching by name 

After you've clicked in `Manage new participant` you'll go to the form to enter the personal data to check against the verification:

After this data is confirmed then there'll be a session for the participant for 30 minutes:

Finally, it's also possible to Promote a participant, meaning that after a participant has been managed, an administrator can add the email and send her an Invitation:
