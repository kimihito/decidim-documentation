To edit projects for voting on, go to the participatory process's submenu, then go to *Features/ Components* and select *Budgetname* (the name that the function has been given). The *PROJECTS* window (<<list-of-projects-for-voting-on-fig>>) will open. Click on the corresponding icons: *Preview* to see how they will look, *Edit, Collections* and *Attachments* for adding documents or *Delete*. This window also lets you see the votes that the various projects have received.

The *Editing Permissions* window opens, in which the criterion must be selected in the drop-down so people can vote. These criteria vary depending on the instance and must be defined when the Decide is installed, although they can be modified later by a programmer. In the example (<<budget-edit-permissions-fig>>), the criteria are: *Everyone, Identify documents (Multy-Step), Code by postal letter (Multi-Step)* and *Example authorization (Direct)*.
