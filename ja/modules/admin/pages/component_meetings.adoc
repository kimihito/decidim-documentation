= Meetings

Meetings are where people come together to discuss or inform about a given topic. All the meetings have a given location (where the meeting will happen) and start and end date and time (when the meeting will happen).

== Types

[NOTE]
====
These different types of Meetings are still in development. At the moment you only have "In-person" and "Official" meetings. Status:

. https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/6572[Online meetings proposed PR]
. https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/6095[Meetings by participants or groups merged PR]. This will be available in v0.23.

Regarding the *location*, depending on the configuration of the Component, you can have:

* In-person meetings: where you get together in a given location
* Online meetings: where you get together using an external service (for instance Jitsi Meet)

There's also two kinds of meetings, depending on who's the one that's making the call:

* Official meetings: the meetings created by the organization (created by an administrator through the panel)
* User meetings: the meetings created by someone external (an User or an UserGroup).
