= Accountability

include::partial$legacy.adoc[]

The *Accountability* component allows people who visit the platform to view the level of execution (global, by categories and / or subcategories), of the results of a participatory process. That is to say, the proposals that have ended up being the result of the decision making in the Decidim, either directly (through the result of the application of a voting system) or mediated by meetings, assemblies, technical or political team, and its degree of execution.

The results can be converted into projects or decomposed into subprojects, which can be described in more detail and for which the execution status can be defined, ranging from 0% execution to 100%. The results, projects and states can be updated through a CVS and manually through the administration interface.

To configure the *Accountability* component, go to the *PROCESSES* submenu and click first on *Features/ Components* then click on *Add feature/ Component* in the upper right part of the window and select *Accountability*. The *ADD FEATURE/ COMPONENT: ACCOUNTABILITY* window will open (<<add-features-components-accountability-fig>>).

The following fields have to be filled in:

* *Name*
* *Weight*: the order in which you wish to display the components in the participatory process's menu.
* *Global settings*:

** Mark Comments enabled if they should be able to comment on the results
** And fill in the fields: *Intro, Name for "Categories", Name for "Subcategories", Name for "Results", Name for "Projects"*.
** Click *Display progress* to show the execution status

* *Default step settings*: For each of the stages (1. Information, 2. Make your proposal, 3. Projects, 4. Budget, 5. Results, 6. Evaluation of the process) tick *Comments blocked* if appropriate (no comments can be made at this stage).

To finish, click on *Add feature/ Component*.
