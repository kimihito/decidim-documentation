* xref:admin:component_proposals.adoc[*PROPOSALS*]: written contributions posted by users on the platform, which can be voted on.
* xref:admin:component_budgets.adoc[*BUDGETS*]: a specific module for deploying a participatory budget process. This allows a minimum percentage of  the total budget to be set for supporting submitted projects.
* xref:admin:component_surveys.adoc[*SURVEY*]: for conducting surveys.
* xref:admin:component_accountability.adoc[*ACCOUNTABILITY*]: follow-up files for initiatives, projects, plans etc. This enables other components such as proposals and face-to-face meetings to be added.
