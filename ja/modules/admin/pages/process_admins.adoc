= Process Admins

include::partial$legacy.adoc[]

Authorisation may be given to other individuals, besides the platform’s general administrators, so that they can administer or collaborate in a certain process or moderate where there are contents that have been reported.

The process *administrators* can configure/ edit a process whereas *collaborators* can only see what is on the administrator menu of the process without being able to configure/ edit.

To register administrators, collaborators and/or moderators of a process, in the process's submenu, go to *Process users* and click on *NEW*.

A *NEW PARTICIPATORY PROCESS USER* window will open (<<new-participatory-process-user-fig>>).
