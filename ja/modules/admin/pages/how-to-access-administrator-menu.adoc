In the *Log in* window (<<Log-In-fig>>) write *Email* and *Password* and click on *Log in*. Remember you will have to have been registered beforehand. Alternatively, you can sign in using your Twitter, Facebook or Google account.

To sign up, you can use the same window (<<Log-In-fig>>), by clicking on *Create an account* (in the upper part of the screen) or *Sign up* (in the lower part), or even on the home page by clicking on *Sign Up*.

Once inside the *Sign up window* (<<Sign-up-fig>>), tick whether you are an *Individual* or *Organization/ Collective*, enter *Your name* (public name that appears on your posts. With the aim of guaranteeing the anonymity, can be any name), *Your short unique identifier in Decidim, Your email, password* you will use, *confirm password* and tick *Receive an occasional newsletter with relevant information* box if you want to receive the information. To finish, click on *By signing up you agree to the terms and conditions of use* (available by clicking on the link), and click on *Sign up*.

It’s also possible to sign up using  Twitter, Facebook or Google accounts.

In addition, organizations should complete the cells: *Organization name, Organization document number* and *phone*.

Once you have finished your registration, you can complete your user-options settings such as additional information or notifications. Click on user name on the top right of the webpage. A drop-down menu will open (<<Accessing-the-user-options-menu-fig>>), where you can access to: *My account, My public profile, Notifications, Conversations, Admin dashboard, Sign out*.

To access the administrator menu, click on the name on the top right of the webpage (in this case, *usuari1*) and select *Admin dashboard* from the drop-down menu. Remember that to access the administrator menu you will need to have your administrator authorisation configured.
